				<h1>Brief Bio</h1>
				<h5><span>Basic</span> Details</h5>
				<p>
					<br>In a world filled with countless sources of entertainment and information, one activity holds a special place in my heart is reading books.
                    I like to immerse my self in this intereset because it transports me to different world, stimulate my imagination, and offer profound insights,
                    the fact that i'm able to do all this just simply by reading a book is something I cherish deeply.
                    <br>The desire to explore new places is one of my other interests that give me joy in this life. Immersing myself in different cultures, and looking for new adventures 
                       is one thing that fills my spirit. I discover this side of me when i was traveling all over Ethiopia a few years back. And it has been my dream since then.
                    <br>
                     Beside coding and solving any problem that I face, one thing i'm capable of doing and have full potential is shaping the lives of young individuals. 
                     I spend most of my free time giving kids tutor and teaching them how to be the best in their school and the things they like.
                     <br><br>

                     for the future I would like to teach young childrens the art of coding and programming and shape the coming generation in the digital world. 
                     other hopes and dreams of mine is owning my own tech company and pave the way for upcoming girl coders, in a world that is mostly dominated by male programers.
